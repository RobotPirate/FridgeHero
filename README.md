FridgeHero created for ScopeSC Spring 2019.

## Notes

I'm currently providing the Signing Certificate for the XCode project (you may need to sign it if it doesn't immediately work your iDevice). I also installed the Dart HTTP package because I think it'll be easier interfacing with an API than to use the SQLite plugin. I'm not sure why the default font is so small, but this can be changed via `ThemeData`.
